# Template p5 project

This project is inspired by the Pokemon Mystery Dungeon personality quiz that assigns the player a Pokemon to play as based on their results. The game would have you take the quiz, then hold your finger down on the screen to "capture your aura" before giving you the results. When I think about this now, it obviously wasn't actually weighing my soul, but when I was a kid playing Pokemon Mystery Dungeon, it felt extremely serious.

The goal with this was to create a quiz that would be fun to take, that would reward the player with an image that "represents" them. The properties of the final image are directly affected by the answers they select. I tried to make the personality traits that I was counting affect parts of the image that made sense together - for example, the more points that the player scored in "excitability", the more points are drawn in the noise. That makes sense, right? Like the more energetic of a person you are, the more visual static and movement your "aura" would have?

My quiz is fully written out with all details attached here.
